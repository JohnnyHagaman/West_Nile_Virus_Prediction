## Introduction

This is my repository for the Chicago Dept. of Public Health's kaggle competition tracking West Nile Virus.

I utilized different classification models to predict which traps would contain a mosquito that tests positvie for WNV. 

My process includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and imputation, feature engineering, dataframe manipulation, modeling and evaluation to optimize my prediction performance based on AUC-ROC scoring.
