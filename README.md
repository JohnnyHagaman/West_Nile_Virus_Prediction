## Introduction

Repository for the Chicago Dept. of Public Health's kaggle competition tracking mosquitos infected with West Nile Virus.

For this competition I tested different classification models to predict which traps would contain a mosquito that tests positvie for WNV. 

My process included exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and imputation, feature engineering, dataframe manipulation, modeling and evaluation to optimize my prediction performance based on AUC-ROC scoring.
